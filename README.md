This report aims to compare multiple ML frameworks to solve the classification task on the MONK Dataset and the regression task on the CUP Dataset provided during the course. 
For the first aim, we compare different Neural Network models using Keras and Pytorch, while for the second dataset, we decided to compare also SVM model using scikit-learn.
